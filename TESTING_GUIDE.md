# LottoDrop Automated Testing Guide

## 🎯 Overview

LottoDrop uses two testing frameworks:
1. **Vitest** - Unit and Integration tests (fast, for components/hooks/services)
2. **Playwright** - End-to-End tests (slower, full browser automation)

## 🚀 Quick Start

### Run All Tests (Recommended)
```bash
cd /Users/rd/Documents/Projects/LottoDrop/frontend
npm run test:run
```
**What it does**: Runs all unit/integration tests once and exits
**When to use**: Before deploying, after making changes
**Duration**: ~5 minutes

### Run Tests in Watch Mode (Development)
```bash
npm test
```
**What it does**: Watches for file changes and re-runs affected tests automatically
**When to use**: While actively coding
**Duration**: Continuous

## 📊 Test Commands Explained

### Unit/Integration Tests (Vitest)

| Command | Description | When to Use |
|---------|-------------|-------------|
| `npm test` | Watch mode - auto-reruns on file changes | During active development |
| `npm run test:run` | Run once and exit | Before commits/deploys |
| `npm run test:ui` | Interactive visual UI for tests | Debugging test failures |
| `npm run test:coverage` | Generate code coverage report | Check test completeness |

### End-to-End Tests (Playwright)

| Command | Description | When to Use |
|---------|-------------|-------------|
| `npm run test:e2e` | Run E2E tests headless | CI/CD pipelines |
| `npm run test:e2e:ui` | Interactive Playwright UI | Debugging E2E failures |
| `npm run test:e2e:headed` | Run with visible browser | Watching tests execute |
| `npm run test:e2e:debug` | Step-by-step debugging | Complex E2E issues |
| `npm run test:e2e:report` | View test report | After E2E run |

## 📝 Current Test Status (October 26, 2025)

### ✅ Passing Tests
- **Avatar Component**: 5 tests ✓
- **useGameStateMachine Hook**: 19 tests ✓ (1 skipped)
- **ErrorBoundary Component**: 10 tests ✓
- **Total Passing**: 35 tests

### ⚠️ Known Issues

**Overall Test Health**: 48% passing (35/73 tests)

## 🎯 Testing Your Recent Changes

### Option 1: Run Specific Test File
```bash
# Test the state machine (covers BUG-024, BUG-025)
npm test -- useGameStateMachine

# Test error boundaries
npm test -- ErrorBoundary

# Test avatar component
npm test -- Avatar
```

### Option 2: Run Tests Related to Changed Files
```bash
# Vitest automatically detects changed files in watch mode
npm test

# Then press 'a' to run all tests
# Or press 'f' to run only failed tests
```

### Option 3: Run Full Test Suite
```bash
# Clean run of all tests
npm run test:run
```

## 🐛 Testing the Bugs You Just Fixed

### BUG-024: Frozen Confetti Particles
**Files Changed**:
- `src/components/animations/Celebration/Celebration.tsx`
- `src/pages/GameRoom/GameRoom.tsx`

**How to Test**:
```bash
# 1. Run related component tests
npm test -- Celebration

# 2. Manual testing in browser (required for canvas-confetti)
# - Join a game room
# - Wait for round to complete with you as winner
# - Verify confetti animates smoothly (not frozen)
```

**Why Manual Testing Needed**: Canvas-confetti uses browser Canvas API which is difficult to test in unit tests. The ref pattern fix is verified through:
1. TypeScript compilation (no errors)
2. React hooks best practices (useRef + useCallback)
3. Visual confirmation in browser

### BUG-025: VRF Animation Modal Persisting
**Files Changed**:
- `src/pages/GameRoom/GameRoom.tsx`

**How to Test**:
```bash
# 1. Run state machine tests (verify modal state logic)
npm test -- useGameStateMachine

# 2. Manual testing in browser
# - Complete a game round
# - Close winner results modal
# - Verify VRF animation modal disappears
```

## 📊 Understanding Test Output

### Successful Test Run
```
✓ src/components/atoms/Avatar/Avatar.test.tsx (5 tests) 17ms
✓ src/hooks/__tests__/useGameStateMachine.test.ts (20 tests | 1 skipped) 18ms
✓ src/components/error/__tests__/ErrorBoundary.test.tsx (10 tests) 62ms

Test Files  3 passed (3)
Tests  35 passed (35)
```

### Failed Test Run
```
❌ FAIL src/services/audio/__tests__/AudioService.test.ts
Error: Test timed out in 5000ms.

Test Files  1 failed | 2 passed (3)
Tests  5 failed | 30 passed (35)
```

## 🔍 Interactive Testing (Recommended for Debugging)

### Vitest UI Mode
```bash
npm run test:ui
```
This opens a web interface at http://localhost:51204 where you can:
- See test results visually
- Click on tests to see details
- Re-run individual tests
- View code coverage
- See console logs for each test

### Playwright UI Mode
```bash
npm run test:e2e:ui
```
This opens Playwright's UI where you can:
- Watch tests execute in real-time
- Step through test actions
- See network requests
- Inspect page state at any point
- Debug failed assertions

## 📈 Test Coverage

### Generate Coverage Report
```bash
npm run test:coverage
```

**Output**: Creates a `coverage/` directory with HTML report

**View Report**:
```bash
open coverage/index.html  # Mac
start coverage/index.html # Windows
xdg-open coverage/index.html # Linux
```

**Current Coverage Goals**:
- Components: >80%
- Hooks: >90% (critical game logic)
- Services: >70%
- Overall: >80%

## ✅ Pre-Deployment Checklist

Before deploying changes to production:

```bash
# 1. Run all unit tests
npm run test:run

# 2. Check for TypeScript errors
npm run build

# 3. Run E2E tests (if available)
npm run test:e2e

# 4. Verify Docker build
cd ..
docker-compose build frontend
docker-compose up -d frontend

# 5. Manual smoke tests
# - Visit http://localhost:80
# - Join a game room
# - Complete a round
# - Verify animations work
```

## 🔧 Common Issues & Solutions

### Issue: Tests Timing Out
**Symptom**: `Error: Test timed out in 5000ms`
**Solution**:
- Increase timeout in test file: `{ timeout: 10000 }`
- Or skip problematic tests: `it.skip('test name', ...)`

### Issue: Watch Mode Not Detecting Changes
**Symptom**: File saved but tests don't re-run
**Solution**:
- Stop and restart `npm test`
- Check file is within `src/` directory
- Verify test file ends with `.test.ts` or `.test.tsx`

### Issue: Mocking Errors
**Symptom**: `vi.fn() mock did not use 'function' or 'class'`
**Solution**: Use proper class mocking pattern
```typescript
// ❌ Wrong
global.AudioContext = vi.fn(() => mockContext)

// ✅ Correct
global.AudioContext = vi.fn(function(this: AudioContext) {
  return mockContext
})
```

## 📚 Best Practices

### 1. Run Tests Before Committing
```bash
# Add to your git pre-commit hook
npm run test:run && npm run build
```

### 2. Test-Driven Development (TDD)
```bash
# 1. Write failing test first
npm test -- YourFeature

# 2. Implement feature
# (edit code)

# 3. Verify test passes
npm test -- YourFeature
```

### 3. Focus on Critical Paths
Priority order for testing:
1. **useGameStateMachine** - Core game logic (CRITICAL)
2. **ErrorBoundary** - Prevents app crashes (HIGH)
3. **WinnerReveal** - User-facing animations (MEDIUM)
4. **AudioService** - Enhancement (LOW)

### 4. Keep Tests Fast
- Unit tests should run in <100ms each
- Integration tests <1s each
- E2E tests <30s each

## 📞 Getting Help

If tests fail and you're unsure why:

1. Run test in UI mode: `npm run test:ui`
2. Check console output for specific errors
3. Read the assertion message carefully
4. Check if test setup/teardown is correct
5. Verify mocks are properly configured
