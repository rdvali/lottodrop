# BUG-026 Testing Report: Room List Visual State Not Updating After Game Completion

## Test Metadata
- **Bug ID**: BUG-026
- **Test Date**: October 27, 2025
- **Environment**: Docker Production Environment (localhost:80)
- **Build Version**: Frontend v0.0.0 (Vite 7.1.5)
- **Tester**: Manual QA Tester Agent
- **Status**: IN PROGRESS

---

## Bug Summary

### Problem
When a user stays on the Room List page and a game finishes, the room card incorrectly showed "Joined" status with a green "View Room" button even after the game completed and reset. The data updated correctly but the visual state remained stuck.

### Root Cause
The `participants` array was not being cleared when a game completed, causing the 60-second polling interval to re-add users to the `joinedRooms` Set based on stale participant data.

### Fix Implementation
**File**: `/Users/rd/Documents/Projects/LottoDrop/frontend/src/pages/RoomList/RoomList.tsx`

**Two-Layer Defense Strategy**:

#### Layer 1: Immediate Participants Array Clearance (Line 170)
```typescript
setRooms(prev => prev.map(room =>
  room.id === data.roomId
    ? {
        ...room,
        status: 'completed',
        currentParticipants: 0,
        participants: [] // CRITICAL: Clear participants array immediately
      }
    : room
))
```

#### Layer 2: Skip Completed Rooms in Status Check (Lines 34-39)
```typescript
const updateJoinedRooms = useCallback((roomsData: Room[]) => {
  if (user) {
    const userJoinedRooms = new Set<string>()
    roomsData.forEach(room => {
      // CRITICAL: Only check 'waiting' or 'in_progress' rooms
      if (room.status !== 'waiting' && room.status !== 'in_progress') {
        return // Skip completed/unknown status rooms
      }
      // ... rest of logic
    })
  }
}, [user])
```

## Preliminary Assessment

### Code Review Findings ‚úÖ

#### Fix Implementation Quality: EXCELLENT
1. **Layer 1 (Immediate Clearance)**: ‚úÖ CORRECT
   - Clears `participants` array in `handleGlobalGameCompleted`
   - Sets `currentParticipants: 0`
   - Updates status to 'completed'
   - Removes user from `joinedRooms` Set

2. **Layer 2 (Polling Protection)**: ‚úÖ CORRECT
   - `updateJoinedRooms` skips non-active rooms
   - Prevents stale data from re-entering state
   - Clean defensive programming

3. **Code Quality**: ‚úÖ HIGH
   - Clear comments explaining critical fixes
   - TypeScript type safety maintained
   - No eslint/tsc errors
   - Follows React best practices

### Potential Edge Cases Identified
1. ‚ö†Ô∏è **Race Condition**: Multiple rapid completions (addressed by Layer 2)
2. ‚ö†Ô∏è **Network Latency**: Slow WebSocket events (polling provides fallback)
3. ‚ö†Ô∏è **Browser Tab Inactive**: Throttled timers (WebSocket events should wake)
4. ‚ö†Ô∏è **Concurrent Users**: Multiple users in same room (backend handles atomically)

### Confidence Level: HIGH
- Fix addresses root cause directly
- Two-layer defense provides redundancy
- Code is clean and maintainable
- Build verification passed

## Next Steps

1. ‚úÖ Complete Test Case 1 (highest priority)
2. ‚è≥ Execute remaining test cases 2-5
3. ‚è≥ Perform cross-browser testing
4. ‚è≥ Execute regression test suite
5. ‚è≥ Analyze performance metrics
6. ‚è≥ Compile final recommendation
